      p In 2004, these cool experimental social psychologists, Anita Smith and Dr. Kipling D Williams, researched group chat exclusion. They used the Need-Threat model<a href="/bibliography.pug#18"><sup>18</sup></a> of ostracism, developed by Williams, to see if leaving someone out of a group chat is cyberostracism. In this model, Williams provides a definition for ostracism, describing the four fundamental needs that are threatened by ostracism.

      p These psychologists started by measuring how present each of the four needs were in the experiment participants. In their experiment, they made someone feel as if theyâ€™d been left out of a group chat, then measured those four needs again. They found out that being excluded from a group chat significantly lowers all four fundamental needs, qualifying as cyberostracism<a href="/bibliography.pug#23"><sup>23</sup></a>.
